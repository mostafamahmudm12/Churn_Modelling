'''Overview:
The Churn Modelling Project is designed to predict customer churn for a business. Churn refers to the loss of customers, and predicting it can help businesses take proactive steps to retain valuable customers. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze customer data and identify patterns that lead to churn.

'''
Features:

Customer Data Analysis: Insights into customer behavior and attributes.

Machine Learning Models: Training and evaluation of models for churn prediction.

Visualization: Clear and concise representation of data and results.

API Integration: Optional deployment of the model as an API for real-time predictions.'''

'''Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains customer information such as:

Customer ID

Credit Score

Geography

Gender

Age

Tenure

Balance

Number of Products

Has Credit Card

Is Active Member

Estimated Salary

Exited (Target Variable: 1 for churned, 0 for retained)'''

'''
Workflow

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.

Encode categorical variables.

Normalize numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understand data distribution and correlations.

Identify key features influencing churn.

Model Development:

Split data into training and testing sets.

Train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.

Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Deployment (Optional):

Save the trained model using joblib or pickle.

Deploy the model as a REST API using Flask or FastAPI.
